# What is Sagemaker?

## Overview of machine learning with Amazon SageMaker

In machine learning, you "teach" a computer to make predictions, or inferences. 
First, you use an algorithm and example data to train a model. 
Then you integrate your model into your application to generate inferences in real time and at scale. 
In a production environment, a model typically learns from millions of example data items and produces inferences in hundreds to less than 20 milliseconds.
